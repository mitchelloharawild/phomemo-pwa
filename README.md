**Labelync** (label + sync) allows you to wirelessly print to Bluetooth label printers directly from your web browser. Install it as a PWA on your phone or computer to print from anywhere, even without an internet connection.

This app uses the [Web Serial API over Bluetooth](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/serial-over-bluetooth/), which requires a modern Chromium-based web browser (Chrome/Chromium 89+, Microsoft Edge 89+, Opera 75+). Safari and Firefox do not currently support the Web Serial API.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply visit <https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/labelync> to start using the app immediately - no installation required!

## 🖨️ Supported Printers

* ✅ **Phomemo M110**
* ❓ **Phomemo M120** (untested)
* ❓ **Phomemo M220** (untested)

I personally own and use a Phomemo M110, and I have not been able to test other devices. All other implementations are based on the fantastic [vivier/phomemo-tools](https://github.com/vivier/phomemo-tools) project. 

**Have a different Phomemo printer?** Please create an issue reporting if this web app works for you (or doesn't)!
