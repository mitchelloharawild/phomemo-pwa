This app uses the [Web Serial API over Bluetooth](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/serial-over-bluetooth/), which requires a modern Chromium-based web browser (Chrome/Chromium 89+, Microsoft Edge 89+, Opera 75+). Safari and Firefox do not currently support the Web Serial API.

## 🖨️ Supported Printers

* ✅ **Phomemo M110**
* ❓ **Phomemo M120** (untested)
* ❓ **Phomemo M220** (untested)

I personally own and use a Phomemo M110, and I have not been able to test other devices. All other implementations are based on the fantastic [vivier/phomemo-tools](https://github.com/vivier/phomemo-tools) project. 

**Have a different Phomemo printer?** Please create an issue reporting if this web app works for you (or doesn't)!
